## About
This package is a sample application that demonstrates how to use the features of `patapata_core`. The processing begins from the main function in `lib/main.dart`.

## Getting started
To run the sample application, either execute `lib/main.dart` or run `flutter run`.

This app also supports the Cupertino design. To run with Cupertino design, either specify `--dart-define=APP_TYPE=cupertino` in the args of `launch.json` or provide `--dart-define=APP_TYPE=cupertino` as an argument with flutter run. 
```
flutter run --dart-define=APP_TYPE=cupertino
```

Note that the default is `--dart-define=APP_TYPE=material`, which applies the Material Design when executed.
